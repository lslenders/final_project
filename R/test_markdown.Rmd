### a time series analysis on the NDVI in Sekoia national park, California.

For more info see the project's github. <https://github.com/lslenders/final_project> 

a planning strategy and project goal can be found in the Wiki.
Here we continue a step by step explanation of our scripting progress. You can follow how we end up with the visualisations.

## 1 Importing Landsat 8 data
```{r}

```

## 2 Calculating NDVI

```{r}

```


## 3 Computing time series analysis within the extent

```{r}

```


## 4 visualise the locations 
```{r}

```





You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=F}
plot(cars)
# Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```
